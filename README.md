Rubber Band Qt Example
======================

A mini Qt-based UI that can load an audio file and adjust its playback
speed dynamically.

This is actually a very, very cut-down version of code used in the
Rubber Band Audio application (https://rubberbandaudio.com/).

To build:

```
$ ./repoint install
$ qmake example.pro
$ make
```
